{title:Examples}

{phang}Read the opendf-file testdata.zip from "https://thartl-diw.github.io/opendf/testdata.zip" into stata. The clear ensures, that the old dataset is removed from stata cache.{p_end}
{phang}With the save()-option the dataset is saved as testdata.dta in the working directory. If it already exists, it testdata.dta is replaced, verbose option is set on.{p_end}
{phang}{cmd:. opendf read "https://thartl-diw.github.io/opendf/testdata.zip", clear save("testdata") replace verbose}{p_end}

{phang}Read the opendf-file testdata.zip from "https://thartl-diw.github.io/opendf/testdata.zip" into stata. The clear ensures, that the old dataset is removed from stata cache.{p_end}
{phang}{cmd:. opendf read "https://thartl-diw.github.io/opendf/testdata.zip", clear}{p_end}

{phang}Read the first 10 lines of the opendf-file testdata.zip from "https://thartl-diw.github.io/opendf/testdata.zip" into stata. Since the first line is also the header, the range has to be set to 11. {p_end}
